### Readme 

This project demonstrates how to wire up and use a proximity sensor with an Arduino. The code monitors the distance between the proximity sensor and an object, and if the distance is too small, the Arduino will make an LED on pin 13 light up to alarm the user.

To import the needed package to run this code from your Arduino, from the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Manage Libraries... > search for NewPing > install it if it is not present on your local computer prior to uploading the code to your Arduino.
